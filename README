orgcreator is designed to run on Ubuntu Linux.
It may run on any other Linux too.

orgcreator creates an organigram from your company and saves it in common graphic formats...
...if you use OrangeHRM as your personnel database, though.


There is some text about orgcreator here: http://freiquell.wordpress.com/2010/01/24/introducing-orgcreator/

If you want to know more about OrangeHRM, go here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/orangehrm/


orgcreator is a very simple program.
Most of the work is done by Graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/

Have fun
